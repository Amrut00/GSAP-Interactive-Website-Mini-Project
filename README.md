# GSAP Interactive Website Project

## Overview
This project is a dynamic and visually engaging website designed to explore the capabilities of **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**. It features scroll-triggered animations, timeline-based transitions, and a modern layout that simulates a landing page for a digital services company.

## Features
- **GSAP Animations:** Seamlessly integrated animations for an engaging user experience.
- **Scroll-Triggered Effects:** Content animations activate as the user scrolls, creating a dynamic flow.
- **Timeline Management:** Coordinated animations using GSAP's timeline feature.
- **Interactive Sections:** A mix of static and animated content, including services and a call-to-action section.

## GSAP Features Used
1. **GSAP Timeline:** 
   - Coordinated animations using a single timeline to control the sequence and timing of element transitions.
   - Example:
     - Animating navigation elements, hero text, and button with delays and staggering for smooth appearance.
     - Transitioning content elements like images and text with synchronized entry effects.

2. **ScrollTrigger Plugin:**
   - Triggering animations based on the user's scroll position.
   - Example:
     - Animating service cards to slide in from the left or right as they come into view.
     - Adding scrubbing effects to ensure animations match the scroll speed for a polished feel.

3. **Staggering Animations:**
   - Adding staggered effects for multiple elements, such as navigation links and logos, for a cascading entry effect.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structuring content.
- **CSS3** for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and animation logic.
- **GSAP** for advanced animations, including ScrollTrigger and timeline-based effects.
